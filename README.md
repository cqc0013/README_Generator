## Installation
To generate your own README, first install inquirer in the terminal with the command `npm install inquirer`. Once Inquirer has been installed, JSON packages and node modules will appear in the repo. After copying the starter code provided in the instructions, run the application with the command `node index.js`.

## Usage
When you run node index.js, you will be prompted by the inquirer package to answer a series of questions in the command line about your GitHub and project. From there, the application will generate a markdown file and a table of contents for the README based on your response to the Inquirer prompts. The README will also include a badge for your repo's license. Lastly, fs.writeFile is used to generate your project's README.md file.
